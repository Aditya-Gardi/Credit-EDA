# Credit-EDA
The Credit EDA project leverages exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques to uncover insights and patterns in credit data. By visualizing and analyzing features such as credit scores, payment history, and debt levels, this project aims to identify trends and correlations, aiding in better credit risk assessment and decision-making.

**Features**
- Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Generating descriptive statistics and visualizations to understand the data distribution and relationships.
- Feature Engineering: Creating new features to improve the performance of predictive models.
- Statistical Analysis: Conducting hypothesis testing and correlation analysis.
- Reporting: Summarizing findings and insights in an easily interpretable format.

**Requirements**
- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scipy

**Installation**
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/credit-eda.git
   cd credit-eda
2. Create a virtual environment:
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
3. Install the dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

**Data**
The dataset used in this project consists of credit-related information, which can be obtained from financial institutions, Kaggle, or other open data sources. Ensure that the data is cleaned and preprocessed before performing EDA.

**Usage**
1. Data Preprocessing:
   Run data_preprocessing.py to clean and prepare the data for analysis.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis:
   Perform EDA using eda.ipynb. This notebook contains code and visualizations to explore the data.
3. Feature Engineering:
   Create new features using feature_engineering.py.
4. Statistical Analysis:
   Conduct hypothesis testing and correlation analysis using statistical_analysis.py.
5. Reporting:
   Summarize the findings and generate reports using reporting.ipynb.

**Contributing**
- Fork the repository.
- Create a new branch (git checkout -b feature-branch).
- Commit your changes (git commit -am 'Add new feature').
- Push to the branch (git push origin feature-branch).
- Create a new Pull Request.
